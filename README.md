# 🗣️ Virtual Voice Assistant – Dory

A simple yet interactive **voice-controlled desktop assistant** built using Python.  
This was my **first-ever Python project**, created during my 4th semester as part of our **Software Development** course.

## 👩‍💻 About the Project

The idea sparked when one of my teammates suggested building a **virtual assistant** that listens and responds to user commands.  
I started exploring resources, primarily learning from a [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeWithHarry) tutorial, and gradually built our own custom assistant: **Dory** 🐠.  
The entire project was developed using **PyCharm**, and the final assistant worked through both a **voice interface** and a **simple GUI** made with `Tkinter`.

## ✨ Personal Note

> This was my very first hands-on project using Python and it helped me understand how powerful and fun automation can be.  
> I still remember how excited I felt when the assistant responded to my voice commands for the first time — it felt like magic!  
> Looking back, this project will always remain special as it laid the foundation of my journey in tech and problem-solving.
